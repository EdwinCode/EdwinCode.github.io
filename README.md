My site where I toss some ideas.

Currently working on learning Go. I may write done some notes here.
I will aslo be attempting LeetCode problems.

# March 30, 2021

Read up on the implementation of a LinkedList via Building Java Programs 5e and have gained a lot of insight on how to approach the Add Two Numbers problem from LeetCode in a simpler manner.

# March 29, 2021

Did a first attempt at the Add Two Numbers problem which utilizes information about the implementation of a LinkedList. Ran into a problem where my nodes are in the wrong spot by one location. As such, I will read up on LinkedList implementation to attempt this problem again with a more solid understanding.
